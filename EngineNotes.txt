TOP-LEVEL:
- PHYSICS ENGINE

3. Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
7. Add some form of primitives(Rectangle, circles, spheres, triangles)
9. =  Non-perspective views (Orthogonal views)
10. Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale)
11. More control over textures(filtering, formatting etc.)
13. Window should have more properties (Center position, fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
14. Better Vector math(normalisation, +=, commonly used vector constants, swizzling support)
15. Options class/system, some place to read values that the player chooses
19. Eventually make easier way to generate Mesh
20. Eventually make easier way of generating texture coordinates
23. Give vectors a copy constructor
25. Transparency support
26. Sprite support
29. Some way to actually display text(UI)
