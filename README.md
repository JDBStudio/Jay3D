><p>Just a personal project to start working on a functional 3D engine using OpenGL/LWJGL.</p>

><p>README will be updated after I actually start implementing demos to test lighting, shaders etc. to pick out bugs and >features.</p>

ADDED:
-----
 - Mesh Model loader(only supports .obj right now)
 - Basic temporary shaders(will implement proper ones later)
 - Full VBO/IBO Mesh rendering implemented
 - Bunch of other crap that I forgot to document, feel free to check the commits
 - Added free camera movement
 - Added textures and texture loader
 - Added lighting(Exclude mapping, haven't done that yet)
  - Pointlights, Spotlights, Ambient lights etc.
