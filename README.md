=====

Just a personal project to start working on a functional 3D engine using OpenGL/LWJGL.

README will be updated after I actually start implementing demos to test lighting, shaders etc. to pick out bugs and features.

ADDED:
=====
 - Mesh Model loader(only supports .obj right now)
 - Basic temporary shaders(will implement proper ones later)
 - Full VBO/IBO Mesh rendering implemented
 - Bunch of other crap that I forgot to document, feel free to check the commits
 - Added free camera movement
 - Added textures and texture loader
 - Added basic lighting
